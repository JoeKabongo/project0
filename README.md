I made a website about my top 6 basketball player in the NBA.

The homepage contains a link to each player profile_image

Each player page contains their informations(height, date of birth, teams played for etc)
, their career stats and last season(2017, 2018) stats, and 3 embed youtube showing them in action.

There is also a about me page where I talk a little bit about myself.
